## üôè Acknowledgements

Our model is built upon the following excellent open-source projects:

- ü§ó [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) ‚Äì the baseline of this project and code for mask synthesis is based on its implementation of Stable Diffusion.
- üß† [Semantic Diffusion Model by Weilun Wang](https://github.com/WeilunWang/semantic-diffusion-model) ‚Äì semantic-aware conditioning framework

We thank the authors for their contributions to the open-source community.
